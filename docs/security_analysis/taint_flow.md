# Taint Flow

## Optimized Taint Flow

When dealing with frameworks, keeping track of the data flow might involve different layers
and even other 3rd party components. Using the `@psalm-flow` annotation allows PsalmPHP to
take a shortcut and to make a tainted data flow more explicit.

### Proxy hint

```php
<?php // --taint-analysis
/**
 * @psalm-flow proxy exec($value)
 */
function process(string $value): void {}

process($_GET['malicious'] ?? '');
```

The example above states, that the function `process($value)` is a proxy of the native PHP
function `exec($value)` - which is potentially vulnerable to code execution (`TaintedShell`).

**Examples**

+ `@psalm-flow proxy exec($value)` referencing the global/scoped function `exec`
+ `@psalm-flow proxy MyClass::mySinkMethod($value)` referencing a function/method of the class `MyClass`

### Return value hint

```php
<?php // --taint-analysis
/**
 * @psalm-flow ($value, $items) -> return
 */
function inputOutputHandler(string $value, string ...$items): string
{
    // lots of complicated magic
}

echo inputOutputHandler('first', 'second', $_GET['malicious'] ?? '');
```

The example above states, that the function parameters `$value` and `$items` are reflected
again in the return value. Thus, in case any of the input parameters to the function
`inputOutputHandler` is tainted, then the resulting return value is as well. In this
example `TaintedHtml` would be detected due to using `echo`.

### Object to return value hint

```php
<?php // --taint-analysis
interface Message
{
    /**
     * @psalm-taint-specialize
     * @psalm-flow ($this) -> return
     */
    public function getBody(): string;
}

/**
 * @psalm-taint-source input
 */
function fetch(): Message {
    // a request to another server
}

echo fetch()->getBody();
```

`$this` in a return value hint states that what a method returns holds what the object it is called on holds: here,
the bodies of the messages `fetch()` returns are tainted, while those of the messages the code builds itself only hold
what they were given. This is useful for methods whose bodies Psalm doesn't analyze, such as those of interfaces,
stubs and vendor code. With `@psalm-taint-specialize`, each call returns what its own object holds; without it, what
any object the method is called on holds flows into what every call returns.

### Combined proxy & return value hint

```php
<?php // --taint-analysis
/**
 * @psalm-flow proxy exec($value)
 * @psalm-flow ($value, $items) -> return
 */
function handleInput(string $value, string ...$items): string
{
    // lots of complicated magic
}

echo handleInput($_GET['malicious'] ?? '');
```

The example above combines both previous examples and shows, that the `@psalm-flow` annotation
can be used multiple times. Here, it would lead to detecting both `TaintedHtml` and `TaintedShell`.
