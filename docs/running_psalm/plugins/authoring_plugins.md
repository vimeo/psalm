# Authoring Plugins

## Quick start

### Using a template repository

Head over to [plugin template repository](https://github.com/weirdan/psalm-plugin-skeleton) on Github, login and click `Use this template` button.

### Using skeleton project

Run `composer create-project weirdan/psalm-plugin-skeleton:dev-master your-plugin-name` to quickly bootstrap a new plugin project in `your-plugin-name` folder. Make sure you adjust namespaces in `composer.json`, `Plugin.php` and `tests` folder.


## Stub files

Stub files provide a way to override third-party type information when you cannot add Psalm's extended docblocks to the upstream source files directly.
By convention, stub files have `.phpstub` extension to avoid IDEs treating them as actual php code.

## Generating stubs

Dev-require the library you want to tweak types for, e.g.
```
composer require --dev cakephp/chronos
```
Then generate the stubs
```
vendor/bin/psalm --generate-stubs=stubs/chronos.phpstub
```
Open the generated file and remove everything not related to the library you're stubbing. Tweak the docblocks to provide more accurate types.

## Registering stub files

Skeleton/template project includes the code to register all `.phpstub` files from the `stubs` directory.

To register a stub file manually use `Psalm\Plugin\RegistrationInterface::addStubFile()`.

## Registering custom scanners and analyzers

In addition to XML configuration node `<fileExtensions>` plugins can register their own custom scanner
and analyzer implementations for particular file extensions, e.g.

* `Psalm\Plugin\FileExtensionsInterface::addFileTypeScanner('html', CustomFileScanner::class)`
* `Psalm\Plugin\FileExtensionsInterface::addFileTypeAnalyzer('html', CustomFileAnalyzer::class)`

## Publishing your plugin on Packagist

Follow instructions on packagist.org under 'Publishing Packages' section.

## Advanced topics

### Starting from scratch

Composer-based plugin is a composer package which conforms to these requirements:

1. Its `type` field is set to `psalm-plugin`
2. It has `extra.psalm.pluginClass` subkey in its `composer.json` that reference an entry-point class that will be invoked to register the plugin into Psalm runtime.
3. Entry-point class implements `Psalm\Plugin\PluginEntryPointInterface`

### Psalm API

Plugins may implement one of (or more than one of) `Psalm\Plugin\EventHandler\*` interface(s).

```php
<?php
class SomePlugin implements \Psalm\Plugin\EventHandler\AfterStatementAnalysisInterface
{
}
```

`Psalm\Plugin\EventHandler\*` offers the following interfaces that you can implement:

- `AfterAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm has completed its analysis. Use this hook if you want to do something with the analysis results.
- `AfterClassLikeAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm has completed its analysis of a given class.
- `AfterClassLikeExistenceCheckInterface` - called after Psalm analyzes a reference to a class, interface or trait.
- `AfterClassLikeVisitInterface` - called after Psalm crawls the parsed Abstract Syntax Tree for a class-like (class, interface, trait). Due to caching the AST is crawled the first time Psalm sees the file, and is only re-crawled if the file changes, the cache is cleared, or you're disabling cache with `--no-cache`/`--no-reflection-cache`. Use this if you want to collect or modify information about a class before Psalm begins its analysis.
- `AfterCodebasePopulatedInterface` - called after Psalm has scanned necessary files and populated codebase data.
- `AfterEveryFunctionCallAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm evaluates any function call. Cannot influence the call further.
- `AfterExpressionAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm evaluates an expression.
- `AfterFileAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm analyzes a file.
- `AfterFunctionCallAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm evaluates a function call to any function defined within the project itself. Can alter the return type or perform modifications of the call.
- `AfterFunctionLikeAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm has completed its analysis of a given function-like.
- `AfterMethodCallAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm analyzes a method call.
- `BeforeStatementAnalysisInterface` - called before Psalm evaluates an statement.
- `AfterStatementAnalysisInterface` - called after Psalm evaluates an statement.
- `BeforeAddIssueInterface` - called before Psalm adds an item to it's internal `IssueBuffer`, allows handling code issues individually
- `BeforeFileAnalysisInterface` - called before Psalm analyzes a file.
- `FunctionExistenceProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin function existence checks for one or more functions.
- `FunctionParamsProviderInterface.php` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin function parameter lookup for one or more functions.
- `FunctionReturnTypeProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin function return type lookup for one or more functions.
- `MethodExistenceProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin method existence checks for one or more classes.
- `MethodParamsProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin method parameter lookup for one or more classes.
- `MethodReturnTypeProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin method return type lookup for one or more classes.
- `MethodVisibilityProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin method visibility checks for one or more classes.
- `PropertyExistenceProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin property existence checks for one or more classes.
- `PropertyTypeProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin property type lookup for one or more classes.
- `PropertyVisibilityProviderInterface` - can be used to override Psalm's builtin property visibility checks for one or more classes.
- `DynamicFunctionStorageProviderInterface` - can be used to override signature for one or more functions. It means you can define variadic param list. Infer return type by input args. Define function templates. Also check out `Psalm\Plugin\DynamicFunctionStorage` to find out what api it brings for you to change function's definition.

Here are a couple of example plugins:
 - [StringChecker](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/examples/plugins/StringChecker.php) - checks class references in strings
 - [PreventFloatAssignmentChecker](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/examples/plugins/PreventFloatAssignmentChecker.php) - prevents assignment to floats
 - [FunctionCasingChecker](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/examples/plugins/FunctionCasingChecker.php) - checks that your functions and methods are correctly-cased

To ensure your plugin runs when Psalm does, add it to your [config](../configuration.md) (not needed for composer-based plugins):
```xml
    <plugins>
        <plugin filename="src/plugins/SomePlugin.php" />
    </plugins>
```

You can also specify an absolute path to your plugin:
```xml
    <plugins>
        <plugin filename="/path/to/SomePlugin.php" />
    </plugins>
```

### Using Xdebug

As Psalm disables _Xdebug_ at runtime, if you need to debug your code step-by-step when authoring a plugin, you can allow the extension by running Psalm as following:

```console
$ PSALM_ALLOW_XDEBUG=1 path/to/psalm
```

## Type system

Understand how Psalm handles types by [reading this guide](plugins_type_system.md).

## Handling custom plugin issues

Plugins may sometimes need to emit their own issues (i.e. not emit one of the [existing issues](../issues.md)). If this is the case, they can emit an issue that extends `Psalm\Issue\PluginIssue`.

To suppress a custom plugin issue in docblocks you can just use its issue name (e.g. `/** @psalm-suppress NoFloatAssignment */`, but to [suppress it in Psalmâ€™s config](../dealing_with_code_issues.md#config-suppression) you must use the pattern:

```xml
<PluginIssue name="NoFloatAssignment" errorLevel="suppress" />
```

You can also use more complex rules in the `<issueHandler />` element, as you can with any other issue type e.g.

```xml
<PluginIssue name="NoFloatAssignment">
    <errorLevel type="suppress">
        <directory name="tests" />
    </errorLevel>
</PluginIssue>
```

## Upgrading file-based plugin to composer-based version

Create new plugin project using skeleton, then pass the class name of you file-based plugin to `registerHooksFromClass()`
method of the `Psalm\Plugin\RegistrationInterface` instance that was passed into your plugin entry point's `__invoke()`
method. See the [conversion example](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/tree/master/examples/plugins/composer-based/echo-checker/).
