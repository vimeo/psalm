# Upgrading from Psalm 4 to Psalm 5
## Changed
- [BC] TPositiveInt has been removed and replaced by TIntRange

- [BC] The parameter `$php_version` of `Psalm\Type\Atomic::create()` renamed
  to `$analysis_php_version_id` and changed from `array|null` to `int|null`.
  Previously it accepted PHP version as `array{major_version, minor_version}`
  while now it accepts version ID, similar to how [`PHP_VERSION_ID` is
  calculated](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.php-version-id).

- [BC] The parameter `$php_version` of `Psalm\Type::parseString()` renamed to
  `$analysis_php_version_id` and changed from `array|null` to `int|null`.
  Previously it accepted PHP version as `array{major_version, minor_version}`
  while now it accepts version ID.

- [BC] Parameter 0 of `canBeFullyExpressedInPhp()` of the classes listed below
  changed name from `php_major_version` to `analysis_php_version_id`.

- [BC] `Atomic::__toString()` used to return a string representation of the type that was using double quotes (`"`) to quote literals. This is now using single quotes (`'`) to be more aligned with the rest of the codebase.
- [BC] `Atomic::__toString()` is now final
- [BC] `Atomic::__toString()` now returns a more detailed version of the type (it calls `getId()` under the hood)
- [BC] Atomic::getId() has now a first param $exact. Calling the method with false will return a less detailed version of the type in some cases (similarly to what `__toString` used to return)
- [BC] To remove a variable from the context, use `Context::remove()`. Calling
  `unset($context->vars_in_scope[$var_id])` can cause problems when using references.
