# Upgrading from Psalm 5 to Psalm 6
## Changed

- The minimum PHP version was raised to PHP 8.1.17.

- [BC] The configuration settings `ignoreInternalFunctionFalseReturn` and `ignoreInternalFunctionNullReturn` are now defaulted to `false`

- [BC] Switched the internal representation of `list<T>` and `non-empty-list<T>` from the TList and TNonEmptyList classes to an unsealed list shape: the TList, TNonEmptyList and TCallableList classes were removed.
  Nothing will change for users: the `list<T>` and `non-empty-list<T>` syntax will remain supported and its semantics unchanged.
  Psalm 5 already deprecates the `TList`, `TNonEmptyList` and `TCallableList` classes: use `\Psalm\Type::getListAtomic`, `\Psalm\Type::getNonEmptyListAtomic` and `\Psalm\Type::getCallableListAtomic` to instantiate list atomics, or directly instantiate TKeyedArray objects with `is_list=true` where appropriate.

- [BC] The only optional boolean parameter of `TKeyedArray::getGenericArrayType` was removed, and was replaced with a string parameter with a different meaning.

- [BC] The `TDependentListKey` type was removed and replaced with an optional property of the `TIntRange` type.
- 
- [BC] `TCallableArray` and `TCallableList` removed and replaced with `TCallableKeyedArray`.

- [BC] Class `Psalm\Issue\MixedInferredReturnType` was removed

- [BC] Value of constant `Psalm\Type\TaintKindGroup::ALL_INPUT` changed to reflect new `TaintKind::INPUT_EXTRACT`, `TaintKind::INPUT_SESSION`, `TaintKind::INPUT_SLEEP` and `TaintKind::INPUT_XPATH` have been added. Accordingly, default values for `$taint` parameters of `Psalm\Codebase::addTaintSource()` and `Psalm\Codebase::addTaintSink()` have been changed as well.

- [BC] Property `Config::$shepherd_host` was replaced with `Config::$shepherd_endpoint`

- [BC] Methods `Codebase::getSymbolLocation()` and `Codebase::getSymbolInformation()` were replaced with `Codebase::getSymbolLocationByReference()`

- [BC] Method `Psalm\Type\Atomic\TKeyedArray::getList()` was removed

- [BC] Method `Psalm\Storage\FunctionLikeStorage::getSignature()` was replaced with `FunctionLikeStorage::getCompletionSignature()`

- [BC] Property `Psalm\Storage\FunctionLikeStorage::$unused_docblock_params` was replaced with `FunctionLikeStorage::$unused_docblock_parameters`

- [BC] Method `Plugin\Shepherd::getCurlErrorMessage()` was removed

- [BC] Property `Config::$find_unused_code` changed default value from false to true

- [BC] Property `Config::$find_unused_baseline_entry` changed default value from false to true

- [BC] The return type of `Psalm\Internal\LanguageServer\ProtocolWriter#write() changed from `Amp\Promise` to `void` due to the switch to Amp v3

- [BC] All parameters, properties and return typehints are now strictly typed.

- [BC] `strict_types` is now applied to all files of the Psalm codebase.

- [BC] Properties `Psalm\Type\Atomic\TLiteralFloat::$value` and `Psalm\Type\Atomic\TLiteralInt::$value` became typed (`float` and `int` respectively)

- [BC] Property `Psalm\Storage\EnumCaseStorage::$value` changed from `int|string|null` to `TLiteralInt|TLiteralString|null`

- [BC] `Psalm\CodeLocation\Raw`, `Psalm\CodeLocation\ParseErrorLocation`, `Psalm\CodeLocation\DocblockTypeLocation`, `Psalm\Report\CountReport`, `Psalm\Type\Atomic\TNonEmptyArray` are now all final.

- [BC] `Psalm\Config` is now final.

- [BC] The return type of `Psalm\Plugin\ArgTypeInferer::infer` changed from `Union|false` to `Union|null`

- [BC] The `extra_types` property and `setIntersectionTypes` method of `Psalm\Type\Atomic\TTypeAlias` were removed.

- [BC] Methods `convertSeverity` and `calculateFingerprint` of `Psalm\Report\CodeClimateReport` were removed.

# Upgrading from Psalm 4 to Psalm 5
## Changed

- [BC] Shaped arrays can now be sealed: this brings many assertion improvements and bugfixes, see [the docs for more info](https://psalm.dev/docs/annotating_code/type_syntax/array_types/#sealed-object-like-arrays).

- [BC] All atomic types, `Psalm\Type\Union`, `Psalm\CodeLocation` and storages are fully immutable, use the new setter methods or the new constructors to change properties: these setter methods will return new instances without altering the original instance.  
  Full immutability fixes a whole class of bugs that occurred in multithreaded mode, you can now feel free to use `--threads=$(nproc)` ;)
  Full immutability also makes Psalm run faster, even in single-threaded mode, by removing all superfluous `clone`s!
  For this purpose, `__clone` was also made private, forbidding the cloning of atomics, unions and storages (an old and brittle pattern used to avoid side-effects caused by mutability).  

- [BC] `Psalm\Type\Union`s are now fully immutable, pre-existing in-place mutator methods were removed and moved into `Psalm\Type\MutableUnion`.  
  To modify a union type, usage of the new setter methods in `Psalm\Type\Union` is strongly recommended.  
  When many consecutive property sets are required, use `Psalm\Type\Union::setProperties` method to avoid creating a new instance for each set.  
  All setter methods will return a new instance of the type without altering the original instance.  
  If many property sets are required throughout multiple methods on a single Union instance, use `Psalm\Type\Union::getBuilder` to turn a `Psalm\Type\Union` into a `Psalm\Type\MutableUnion`: once you're done, use `Psalm\Type\MutableUnion::freeze` to get a new `Psalm\Type\Union`.  
  Methods removed from `Psalm\Type\Union` and moved into `Psalm\Type\MutableUnion`:

   - `replaceTypes`
   - `addType`
   - `removeType`
   - `substitute`
   - `replaceClassLike`

- [BC] `Psalm\Type\TypeNode::getChildNodes()` was removed, use `Psalm\Type\Union::getAtomicTypes()` to get the types of a union, and use `Psalm\Type\TypeVisitor` with the new `Psalm\Type\MutableTypeVisitor` class to iterate over a type tree.  

- [BC] `Psalm\Type\TypeVisitor` is now fully immutable, implementors MUST NOT alter type nodes during iteration: use `Psalm\Type\MutableTypeVisitor` if type node mutation is desired.  

- [BC] TPositiveInt has been removed and replaced by TIntRange

- [BC] Property `Psalm\Config::$cache_directory` is now internal. Use
  `Psalm\Config::getCacheDirectory()` instead.

- [BC] The parameter `$php_version` of `Psalm\Type\Atomic::create()` renamed
  to `$analysis_php_version_id` and changed from `array|null` to `int|null`.
  Previously it accepted PHP version as `array{major_version, minor_version}`
  while now it accepts version ID, similar to how [`PHP_VERSION_ID` is
  calculated](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php#constant.php-version-id).

- [BC] The parameter `$php_version` of `Psalm\Type::parseString()` renamed to
  `$analysis_php_version_id` and changed from `array|null` to `int|null`.
  Previously it accepted PHP version as `array{major_version, minor_version}`
  while now it accepts version ID.

- [BC] Parameter 0 of `canBeFullyExpressedInPhp()` of the classes listed below
  changed name from `php_major_version` to `analysis_php_version_id`.
